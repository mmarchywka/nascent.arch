\mjmabstract{OBJECTIVES
   Evidence points towards an important relationship between the antidepressant effects of electroconvulsive
   therapy (ECT) and the modulation of the immune system. To further elucidate this interplay, we performed a
   study on the effects of the antidepressant treatment by ECT on 25 cytokines in patients with depression.
CONCLUSIONS
   Although the sample size was small, we found different effects of the ECT treatment per se and of the
   antidepressant action induced by ECT in CSF and blood.

\mjmabstract{BACKGROUND
   Obesity, type 2 diabetes (T2D), dyslipidemia, arterial hypertension as well as hepatic steatosis (HS) are
   common conditions that can affect clinical outcomes of patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) who achieved
   sustained virological response (SVR). The aim of this study was to assess the impact of metabolic cofactors on
   the occurrence of clinical events during follow-up (FU) in a group of CHC long term responders (LTRs) to
   interferon (IFN) -based therapy.
CONCLUSIONS
   In CHC-LTRs, HS at baseline may predispose to the development of cardiovascular events and T2D during follow-up
   emphasizing the importance of an accurate counseling in order to prevent extra-hepatic complications.

\mjmabstract{   Herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) is the most common infectious disease of the central nervous system
   worldwide. However, the pathogenesis of HSE is not clear. Research has shown that the immune response mediated
   by the toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) signaling pathway is essential to protect the central nervous system against
   herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. However, an excessive immune response may cause tissue damage accompanied
   by pathological changes. The aim of this study was to explore the molecular mechanism via which corilagin
   controls HSE through the TLR3 signaling pathway in vitro and in vivo. Cells and mice were pre-treated with
   polyriboinosinic polyribocytidylic acid poly(IC) or HSV type 1, and then treated with corilagin. After
   treatment, the mRNA and protein levels of TLR3, TLR-like receptor-associated interferon factor (TRIF), tumor
   necrosis factor (TNF) receptor type 1-associated DEATH domain protein (TRADD), TNF receptor-associated factor
   (TRAF) 3 and 6, nuclear factor-kappa-B (NF-B) essential modulator (NEMO), P38, and interferon regulatory
   factor 3 (IRF3) were decreased. Interleukin-6 (IL-6), TNF-, and type 1 interferon- were also decreased. When
   TLR3 expression was silenced or increased, corilagin still inhibited the expression of TLR3 and its downstream
   mediators. Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining and immunohistochemical examinations of mouse brain tissues revealed
   that corilagin lessened the degree of brain inflammation. Altogether, these results suggest that corilagin may
   regulate the immune response in HSE and relieve inflammatory injury by interfering with the TLR3 signaling
   pathway.

\mjmabstract{   We evaluated the relationship between interferon-induced transmembrane protein 1 (IFITM1) expression,
   epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) signature and angiogenesis in lung adenocarcinoma. Additionally, we
   examined prognostic significance of IFITM1 according to pTNM stage to confirm that IFITM1 can serve as a
   complement to the pTNM stage. A total of 141 lung adenocarcinoma specimens were evaluated retrospectively by
   immunohistochemical staining for IFITM1, EMT markers (e-cadherin, -catenin, and vimentin), and CD31 to measure
   microvessel density. IFITM1was expressed in 46.8% of the specimens. IFITM1 expression was significantly
   correlated with increased microvessel density (P=0.048). However, IFITM1 expression was not associated with
   three EMT markers. In a multivariate analysis, IFITM1 was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival
   in a multivariate analysis (hazard ratio 2.59, P=0.01). Online database with data from 720 lung
   adenocarcinoma patients also revealed a negative prognostic significance of IFITM1 (P<0.001). Furthermore,
   high IFITM1 expression was significantly correlated with decreased OS rates in each pTNM stage. IFITM1 is
   significantly correlated with angiogenesis and it may be used as a useful additional prognostic marker to aid
   pTNM classification.

\mjmabstract{   We analyzed the management and outcomes of pregnancies of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia at a single
   center over fifteen years. Among the 203 CML female patients, there were ten pregnancies in seven women, all of
   them not planned. In three cases, the chronic myeloid leukemia diagnosis was made during pregnancy. Five
   patients received tyrosine kinase inhibitors in the first weeks of pregnancy and the drug was interrupted until
   delivery. One patient lost complete cytogenetic response, and two patients lost the hematological response. A
   patient with a stable major molecular response had two successful pregnancies without loss of response. There
   were four premature births. There were no maternal adverse events, fetal malformation or death. All patients
   received Interferon-alpha during gestation, and two received hydroxyurea for a short period. Leukapheresis was
   performed in two patients for hyperleukocytosis control. One patient with sickle cell disease died from disease
   progression six months after delivery. CONCLUSIONS The tyrosine kinase inhibitors ministration should be
   interrupted during pregnancy. Patients should be advised to achieve a stable and deep molecular response if
   they plan to conceive, to avoid the risk of disease progression.

\mjmabstract{BACKGROUND  AIMS
   Hepatitis D virus (HDV) superinfection in patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) is associated with rapid
   progression to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Treatment options are limited, and no vaccine is
   available. Although HDV-specific CD8+ T cells are thought to control the virus, little is known about which
   HDV epitopes are targeted by virus-specific CD8+ T cells or why these cells ultimately fail to control the
   infection. We aimed to define how HDV escapes the CD8+ T-cell-mediated response.
METHODS
   We collected plasma and DNA samples from 104 patients with chronic HDV and HBV infection at medical centers in
   Europe and the Middle East, sequenced HDV, typed human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I alleles from patients,
   and searched for polymorphisms in HDV RNA associated with specific HLA class I alleles. We predicted epitopes
   in HDV that would be recognized by CD8+ T cells and corresponded with the identified virus polymorphisms in
   patients with resolved (n = 12) or chronic (n = 13) HDV infection.
RESULTS
   We identified 21 polymorphisms in HDV that were significantly associated with specific HLA class I alleles (P <
   .005). Five of these polymorphisms were found to correspond to epitopes in HDV that are recognized by CD8+ T
   cells; we confirmed that CD8+ T cells in culture targeted these HDV epitopes. HDV variant peptides were only
   partially cross-recognized by CD8+ T cells isolated from patients, indicating that the virus had escaped
   detection by these cells. These newly identified HDV epitopes were restricted by relatively infrequent HLA
   class I alleles, and they bound most frequently to HLA-B. In contrast, frequent HLA class I alleles were not
   associated with HDV sequence polymorphisms.
CONCLUSIONS
   We analyzed sequences of HDV RNA and HLA class I alleles that present epitope peptides to CD8+ T cells in
   patients with persistent HDV infection. We identified polymorphisms in the HDV proteome that associate with HLA
   class I alleles. Some variant peptides in epitopes from HDV were only partially recognized by CD8+ T cells
   isolated from patients; these could be mutations that allow HDV to escape the immune response, resulting in
   persistent infection. HDV escape from the immune response was associated with uncommon HLA class I alleles,
   indicating that HDV evolves, at the population level, to evade recognition by common HLA class I alleles.

\mjmabstract{   Immune-checkpoint blockades, suchas PD-1 monoclonal antibodies, have shown new promising avenues to treat
   cancers. Failure responsesof many cancer patients to these agents have led to a massive need for alternative
   strategies to optimize tumor immunotherapy. Currently, new therapeutic developments involve peptide blocking
   strategies, as they have high stability and low immunogenicity. Here, we have designed and synthesized a new
   peptide FITC-YT-16 to target PD-1. We have studied FITC-YT-16 by various experiments, including Molecular
   Operating Environment MOE modeling, purification testing by HPLC and LC mass, peptidePD-1 conjugation and
   affinity by microscale thermophoresis (MST), and T cell immune-fluorescence imaging by fluorescence microscopy
   and flow cytometry. The peptide was tested for its ability to enhanceT cell activity against tumor cell lines,
   including TE-13, A549, and MDA-MB-231. Lastly, we assessed T cell cytotoxicity under peptide treatment.
   YT-16PD-1 interaction showed a high binding affinity as a low energy complex that was confirmed by MOE.
   Furthermore, the peptide purity and molecular weights were 90.96% and 2344.66, respectively. MST revealed that
   FITC-YT-16 interacted with PD-1 at a Kd value of 17.8  2.6 nM. T cell imaging and flow cytometry revealed
   high affinity of FITC-YT-16 to PD-1. Interestingly, FITC-YT-16 efficiently blocked PD-1 signaling pathways and
   promoted T cell inflammatory responses by elevating IL-2 and INF- levels. Moreover, FITC-YT-16 has the ability
   to activate T cell cytotoxicity. Therefore, FITC-YT-16 significantly enhanced T cell anti-tumor activity by
   blocking PD-1PD-L1 interactions.

\mjmabstract{OBJECTIVE
   Natural killer (NK) cells are lymphocytes well suited for adoptive immunotherapy. Attempts with adoptive NK
   cell immunotherapy against ovarian cancer have proven unsuccessful, with the main limitations including failure
   to expand and diminished effector function. We investigated if incubation of NK cells with interleukin (IL)-12,
   IL-15, and IL-18 for 16h could produce cytokine-induced memory-like (CIML) NK cells capable of enhanced
   function against ovarian cancer.
METHODS
   NK cells were preactivated briefly with IL-12, IL-15, and IL-18, rested, then placed against ovarian cancer
   targets to assess phenotype and function via flow cytometry. Real-time NK-cell-mediated tumor-killing was
   evaluated. Using ascites cells and cell-free ascites fluid, NK cell proliferation and function within the
   immunosuppressive microenvironment was evaluated in vitro. Finally, CIML NK cells were injected intraperitoneal
   (IP) into an in vivo xenogeneic mouse model of ovarian cancer.
RESULTS
   CIML NK cells demonstrate enhanced cytokine (IFN-) production and NK-cell-mediated killing of ovarian cancer.
   NK cells treated overnight with cytokines led to robust activation characterized by temporal shedding of CD16,
   induction of CD25, and enhanced proliferation. CIML NK cells proliferate more with enhanced effector function
   compared to controls in an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Finally, human CIML NK cells exhibited potent
   antitumor effects within a xenogeneic mouse model of ovarian cancer.
CONCLUSIONS
   CIML NK cells have enhanced functionality and persistence against ovarian cancer in vitro and in vivo, even
   when exposed to ascites fluid. These findings provide a strategy for NK cell-based immunotherapy to circumvent
   the immunosuppressive nature of ovarian cancer.

\mjmabstract{   Malaria is induced by infection with Plasmodium parasites, which are genetically diverse, and the immune
   response to Plasmodium infection has both allele-specific and cross-reactive components. To determine the role
   of the cross-reactive immune response in the protection and disease manifestation in heterologous Plasmodium
   infection, we used infection models of P. chabaudi chabaudi (Pcc) and P. berghei ANKA (PbA). CD4+ T cells
   primed with Pcc infection exhibited strong cross-reactivity to PbA antigens. We infected C57BL6 mice with Pcc
   and subsequently treated them with an anti-Plasmodium drug. The Pcc-primed mice exhibited reduced parasitemia
   and showed no signs of experimental cerebral malaria after infection with PbA. CD4+ T cells from the
   Pcc-primed mice produced high levels of IFN- and IL-10 in response to PbA early after PbA infection. The
   blockade of IL-10 signaling with anti-IL-10 receptor antibody increased the proportion of activated CD4+ and
    T cells and the IFN- production by CD4+ T cells in response to PbA antigens, while markedly reducing the
   levels of parasitemia. In contrast, IL-10 blockade did not have a significant effect on parasitemia levels in
   unprimed mice after PbA infection. These data suggest a potent regulatory role of IL-10 in the cross-reactive
   memory response to the infection with heterologous Plasmodium parasites leading to the inhibition of the
   protective immunity and pathogenesis.

\mjmabstract{   Recent years have seen extremely fast development of new viral nanovaccines and diagnostic agents using
   nanostructures prepared by biological and chemical synthesis. We used spherical gold nanoparticles (average
   diameter, 15 nm) as a platform for the antigen for swine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). The
   literature data demonstrate that immunization of animals with the TGEV antigen coupled to gold nanoparticles
   (GNPs) not only activates antigen-presenting cells but also increases the proliferative activity of splenic
   lymphoid (antibody-forming) cells. The contents of -IFN, IL-1, and IL-6 in animals immunized with GNP-antigen
   conjugates were found to be higher than those in intact animals or in animals given the antigen alone. The
   increased concentration of IL-1 in the immunized animals directly correlated with the activity of macrophages
   and stimulated B cells, which produce this cytokine when activated. The increased concentration of IL-6
   indicates that the injected preparations are stimulatory to cellular immunity. Immunization with the TGEV
   antigen conjugated to GNPs as a carrier activates the respiratory activity of lymphoid cells and peritoneal
   macrophages, which is directly related to their transforming activity and to the activation of antibody
   generation. Furthermore, the use of this conjugate allows marked improvement of the structure of the animals'
   immune organs and restores the morphological-functional state of these organs. The microanatomical changes
   (increased number of follicles) indicate the activation of the B-dependent zone of the spleen and,
   consequently, the development of a humoral-type immunological reaction. The degradative processes observed in
   the animals immunized with TGEV antigen alone are evidence of weak resistance to pathogen attack. These results
   can be used to develop vaccines against this infection by employing TGEV antigen coupled to gold nanoparticles
   as a carrier.

\mjmabstract{   IL-10 and IL-35 suppress excessive immune responses and therapeutic strategies are being developed to increase
   their levels in autoimmune diseases. In this study, we sought to identify major cell types that produce both
   cytokines in-vivo and to characterize mechanisms that regulate their production. Experimental autoimmune
   uveitis (EAU) is a CNS autoimmune disease that serves as model of human uveitis. We induced EAU in C57BL6J
   mice and investigated whether T cells, B lymphocytes, or myeloid cells are the major producers of IL-10 or
   IL-35 in blood, lymph nodes (LNs), spleen, and at the site of ocular inflammation, the neuroretina. Analysis of
   these tissues identified B cells as the major producers of IL-10 and IL-35 in-vivo. Compared to regulatory T
   cells (Tregs), IL-10- or IL-35-producing regulatory B cells (Bregs) are substantially expanded in blood, LNs,
   spleen, and retina of mice with EAU. We performed EMSA and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays on
   activated B cells stimulated with IL-35 or TLR agonists. We found that BATF, IFN regulatory factor (IRF)-4, and
   IRF-8 transcription factors were recruited and bound to AP1-IRF-composite elements (AICEs) of il12a, ebi3,
   andor il10 loci, suggesting their involvement in regulating IL-10 and IL-35 transcriptional programs of B
   cells. Showing that B cells are major source of IL-10 and IL-35 in-vivo and identifying transcription factors
   that contribute to IL-10 and IL-35 expression in the activated B-cell, suggest that the BATFIRF-4IRF-8 axis
   can be exploited therapeutically to regulate physiological levels of IL-10IL-35-Bregs and that adoptive
   transfer of autologous Bregs might be an effective therapy for autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases.

\mjmabstract{   Epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation, play an important role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune
   diseases. In this study, we characterized the DNA methylome in primary T cells of patients with systemic
   sclerosis. Genome-wide DNA methylation assays of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from 24 systemic sclerosis patients
   and 24 matched controls were conducted and differentially methylated regions were validated. In the discovery
   stage, we found that hypomethylation of genes involved in the type I IFN signaling pathway was significantly
   enriched in both CD4+ (P = 7.59  10-6) and CD8+ (P = 2.10  10-8) differentially methylated regions. In
   the validation stage, we confirmed these changes for five type I IFN-associated genes. In addition, protein
   levels of both type I IFN- (P < 0.0001) and  (P = 0.002) were significantly elevated in the sera of systemic
   sclerosis patients. Moreover, significant associations between type I IFN- protein levels with the DNA
   methylation status as well as the expression profiles of these IFN-associated genes were confirmed. In
   conclusion, the type I IFN pathway is dysfunctional at the epigenetic level in systemic sclerosis patients,
   indicating that hypomethylation and upregulation of type I IFN-associated genes might be critical in systemic
   sclerosis pathogenesis.

\mjmabstract{   We found that AKT1, a primary effector molecule of PI3K-AKT signaling, distinctively suppressed Toll-like
   receptor (TLR)-mediated MyD88-dependent and TollIL-1R domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-
   (TRIF)-dependent signaling by inhibiting NF-B activation and IRF3 activity independently of its kinase
   activity. In AKT1 knockout RAW264.7 cells, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced transcription and protein
   production of cytokines including IL-1 and TNF- (regulated by the MyD88-dependent pathway), as well as IFN-
   and RANTES (C-C motif chemokine ligand 5 CCL-5; regulated by the TRIF-dependent pathways) was enhanced
   compared to wild type cells. In response to LPS stimulation, AKT1 knockout cells also exhibited enhanced NF-B
   and IFN- promoter activities, which were reduced to a level comparable to that in wild type cells by
   complementation with either AKT1 or its kinase-dead mutant (AKT1-KD). Expression of AKT1 or AKT1-KD similarly
   suppressed NF-B and IFN- promoter activities induced by LPS and other TLR ligands in wild type cells.
   Analysis of NF-B activation caused by transient expression of proteins involved in the MyD88-dependent pathway
   in TLR signaling revealed that AKT1 suppressed signaling that occurs between activation of IKK and that of
   NF-B. In contrast, AKT1 appeared to suppress the IFN- promoter through inhibition of IRF3 activity itself.
   These results demonstrate a novel, non-kinase function of AKT1 that inhibits TLR signaling, and suggest the
   multifunctional nature of AKT1.
