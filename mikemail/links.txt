Not to typeset (my work is mainly with books and journals) but on the^M
web there is an experimental development for the CELT project^M
(http://research.ucc.ie/celt/) where documents are no longer served in^M
section-based chunks but as very long 'pages' with links and scrolling.^M
It's not finished yet, so not everything is working, and the metadata^M
still needs cleaning, but it does reflect the nature of early documents^M
which often had no visible logical structure because it was left to the^M
reader to work it out (even though the CELT transcriptions are taken^M
from Victorian printed editions). This is unnatural to us, but it was^M
very natural to the reader in the 6th√¢<80><93>14th centuries.^M

Two thoughts:^M
^M
1. My recently released eBook/app, "Hilbert Curves" for iOS, which I demoed=^M
 at the recent TUG conference a few weeks ago, self-typesets each time the =^M
app launches, using its own re-implementation of a TeX language interpreter=^M
.  The typsetting relies on plain.tex and opmac.tex, not LaTeX, for the mar=^M
kup on a TeX source file for the book's text and illustration placement.  B=^M
ecause I wanted most illustrations to be as large as possible on any page, =^M
I purposefully set the logical page size to a longer-than-usual amount comp=^M
ared to that of physical paper, so as to help prevent the otherwise somewha=^M
t chaotic placement of large illustration boxes (a well-known problem with =^M
TeX's float algorithms).  The user can scroll vertically because pages that=^M
 fit horizontally don't fit vertically (and the app has to work on a variet=^M
y of devices all with different screen sizes and orientations).  In some re=^M
spects, I would have liked to get rid of pages altogether, in favor of one =^M
long scroll.  But this would have interfered with the need to keep the eBoo=^M
k/app's memory requirements under control, since nearly all scrollable view=^M
s have a backing store to them these days (at least on Apple devices), espe=^M
cially views that require deeply zoomable, resolution-independent graphics.^M
^M
2. In the legal profession, there is a constant annoyance of having to cite=^M
 to a legal case using page numbers.  The problem is that legal cases get p=^M
ublished in different volumes with different pagination.  Many forward thin=^M
king courts are doing away with page numbers in favor of numbered paragraph=^M
s.  Because paragraph numbers are embedded in the text, rather than imposed=^M
 externally by a changing page or font size, numbered paragraphs are just a=^M
 better and higher-resolution way of citing to somewhere in a published leg=^M
al decision (or any other kind of writing, I suppose).  Eventually, paginat=^M
ion might become irrelevant in legal writing, which means using a single-sc=^M
rolling interface for one super-long "page" would work well (assuming memor=^M
y requirements can be handled).^M
